Delta time (dt) is a fundamental concept in game physics that ensures consistent behavior regardless of frame rate. It represents the amount of time that has elapsed since the last frame. Using delta time, you can scale physics calculations to account for variable frame durations, ensuring smooth and realistic motion.
1. Understanding Delta Time
Why Use Delta Time?

    Without delta time, physics calculations assume a fixed frame rate. If the frame rate fluctuates, entities may move inconsistently.
    Delta time normalizes calculations to simulate motion as if the game is running at a steady rate.

How It Works

    Compute the time elapsed between frames (dt), typically in seconds or milliseconds.
    Scale velocities, accelerations, and other time-sensitive variables by dt to account for the elapsed time.

Conceptual Example

    Imagine an object with a velocity of 10 pixels/second. If a frame lasts 0.016 seconds (dt = 16ms), the object should move:

    distance = velocity * dt = 10 * 0.016 = 0.16 pixels

2. Applying Delta Time in Fixed-Point Arithmetic

Since fixed-point math is used in your context, dt must also be represented as a fixed-point value.
Steps to Use Delta Time

    Convert Delta Time to Fixed-Point:
        If dt is in milliseconds, convert it to a 16.16 fixed-point format:

    dtFixed = (dt << 16) / 1000

Scale Physics Calculations:

    Multiply velocities, accelerations, or forces by dtFixed:

        newVelocity = oldVelocity + (acceleration * dtFixed) >> 16
        newPosition = oldPosition + (velocity * dtFixed) >> 16

3. Time-Sensitive Physics Calculations

Here are examples of physics calculations that depend on delta time:
Velocity Update (Acceleration Integration)

    Velocity changes over time due to acceleration:

    velocity += acceleration * dt

    Example: Gravity applies a constant downward force, causing velocity to increase.

Position Update (Velocity Integration)

    Position changes over time due to velocity:

    position += velocity * dt

    Example: An object moves smoothly based on its velocity.

Friction

    Friction reduces velocity over time, simulating resistance:

    velocity *= (1 - frictionCoefficient * dt)

    Example: A sliding object slows down as it encounters friction.

Bouncing

    When an object collides with a surface, its velocity is reversed and reduced based on the surface’s elasticity:

    velocity = -velocity * elasticity

    Example: A ball bounces back with reduced speed after hitting the ground.

4. Friction
What Is Friction?

    Friction is a force that opposes motion, gradually reducing an object’s velocity.
    It can simulate effects like air resistance or surface drag.

How to Implement Friction

    Linear Friction:
        Apply a constant deceleration proportional to the velocity:

    velocity -= velocity * frictionCoefficient * dt

    Example: A car slows down when you stop accelerating.

Static Friction:

    Stop movement entirely when velocity falls below a small threshold:

        if (abs(velocity) < threshold) velocity = 0

5. Bouncing
What Is Bouncing?

    When an object collides with a surface, it rebounds with a portion of its velocity determined by the coefficient of restitution (elasticity).

How to Implement Bouncing

    Reverse Velocity:
        When an object hits a surface, reverse its velocity in the direction of the collision:

    velocityY = -velocityY

Scale by Elasticity:

    Multiply the velocity by the elasticity coefficient (e.g., 0.8 for 80% energy retention):

    velocityY = -velocityY * elasticity

Stop Small Bounces:

    If the velocity after bouncing is very small, stop the motion entirely:

        if (abs(velocityY) < threshold) velocityY = 0

Example

    A ball falling with velocity -10 hits the ground. If elasticity is 0.6:

    newVelocityY = -(-10) * 0.6 = 6

6. Example: Time-Sensitive Physics System
Scenario

    An object falls due to gravity, slows down on a surface due to friction, and bounces if it hits the ground.

Physics Steps

    Apply Gravity:
        Update velocity:

    velocityY += GRAVITY * dt

Update Position:

    Move the object based on velocity:

    positionY += velocityY * dt

Check for Collisions:

    If the object hits the ground:

    if (positionY >= GROUND_LEVEL) {
        positionY = GROUND_LEVEL;
        velocityY = -velocityY * elasticity; // Bounce
    }

Apply Friction:

    Gradually reduce horizontal velocity:

    velocityX -= velocityX * frictionCoefficient * dt;

Stop Small Movements:

    If velocities are very small, stop them:

        if (abs(velocityX) < threshold) velocityX = 0;
        if (abs(velocityY) < threshold) velocityY = 0;

7. Key Takeaways

    Delta Time:
        Ensures consistent motion across variable frame rates.
        Scales all time-sensitive physics (velocity, position, friction).

    Friction:
        Simulates resistance to motion, gradually reducing velocity.
        Can be linear (proportional to velocity) or static (stopping small movements).

    Bouncing:
        Reverses velocity upon collision.
        Scales rebound speed by elasticity.

    Fixed-Point Math:
        Enables precise and efficient calculations for small values (e.g., low friction or gravity).
