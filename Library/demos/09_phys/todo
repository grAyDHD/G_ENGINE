// degree angle against gravity.  There should be momentum introduced to provide
// bouncing off of walls/platforms. A launch can be performed in the air, only
// if ground has been made contact with since the last use of the launch.
// gravity should have an accellerating effect, and the ball should bounce 0-3
// times depending on collision speed with the ground. can land one of three
// platforms, each emitting a unique collision sound.  launching into side of
// platform is effective to bounce the opposite direction left and right buttons
// move ball left and right at all times. holding 'B' reverses gravity until it
// is released.
