This is a painting program. The player can cycle between paintbrush shapes, as well as increase and decrease size of the brush.
A minimum and maximum size will be set dependant on smallest recognizable drawing of each shape.
These are the shapes:
  square/rectangle
  triangle 
  circle
  star
  hexagon
I'll use asesprite to test draw various sizes for each of these.
The player can choose between a solid and a gradient, as well as select color with RGB sliders ranging 0-31 each (32,678 colors) I think that's the number lol
In gradient mode, there is a range that the player sets, min and max for each slider. Each slider will also have a 3 way toggle for that color values gradient speed.
Meaning, higher speed, that color cycles through it's gradient range faster.
