High Priority:
refactor projects prior to 15 that make sense in doing so for integrating the Entity Component System.
refactor circles project to have functioins to use for music visualizer, draw rings on button hold, erase on release

project 8 input:
refine logic, create basic color macros for library
use ECS for movement

9 physics:
refactor to ECS, integrate gravity from project into ECS

10 timer:
update ECS to utilize a timer component.
(update project 18 for npc to use timer for changing direction)

11 dmg
does this make sense to integrate?
or dmg instrument?

12
fix functionality


Moderate priority:
15:
match SpriteFrame16 function in project 15 to match formatting of SpriteFrame32Bit from 18



18 animator:
update hitboxes (determine specific size/offset within bounds of actual sprite frame) 
currently collisions work, but hitboxes are size of full sprite frame, so transparent regions are colliding


19 text:
debug the printDebug function
refactor print functions to library

LOW PRIORITY:

17 paint: (will address after implementing UI framework project)
if any functions make sense to add into library do so
otherwise, optimize caching and add bounds checking and correct minor bugs in pause menu

move bgscaling/rotation etc to new header- graphics/effects?
current use only in project 16
add GREEN_SWAP to effects
  GREEN_SWAP = 1;
  GREEN_SWAP = 0;
