High Priority:
refactor projects prior to 15 that make sense in doing so for integrating the Entity Component System.
refactor circles project to have functioins to use for music visualizer, draw rings on button hold, erase on release

Moderate priority:
15:
match SpriteFrame16 function in project 15 to match formatting of SpriteFrame32Bit from 18

18 animator:
update collisions/hitboxes 


19 text:
debug the printDebug function
refactor print functions to library

LOW PRIORITY:

17 paint: (will address after implementing UI framework project)
if any functions make sense to add into library do so
otherwise, optimize caching and add bounds checking and correct minor bugs in pause menu

move bgscaling/rotation etc to new header- graphics/effects?
current use only in project 16
add GREEN_SWAP to effects
  GREEN_SWAP = 1;
  GREEN_SWAP = 0;
