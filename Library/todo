integrate memcopy32 into library, test on project 14

fix SpriteFrame drawing in project 15

move bgscaling/rotation etc to new header- graphics/effects?
current use only in project 16
add GREEN_SWAP to effects
  GREEN_SWAP = 1;
  GREEN_SWAP = 0;

Starting from 17, refactor/optimize/finalize current project specs.
17 paint:
if any functions make sense to add into library do so
otherwise, optimize caching and add bounds checking and correct minor bugs in pause menu

18 animator:
consolidate SpriteFrame32 function to incorporate transparency layer
optimize and prep for collision handling by adding sprite height/width frame data
keep consistent for sprite if possible, across all frames.  only copy this region.
copy 4 bytes (2 pixels) at a time as usual (handle odd dimensions???)
handle transparency pixel at a time?  
Might be able to handle to at a time with some bit shifting/masking, but not sure if worth it
 
19 text
