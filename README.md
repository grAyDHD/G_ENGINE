Work in progress as I teach myself the ins and outs of GBA programming.  
Intent is to put together educational content as well as a custom library in C with assembly optimizations, that is approachable for newcomers like myself.  
Great documentation exists, such as libtonc, but it can be difficult to follow some, as it was for me.
