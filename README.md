#G_ENGINE

## Overview
**G_ENGINE**: First and foremost this is a personal educational pursuit, but the broader goal is web based application for GBA development that has simple GUI for assett management and conversion, alongside a library written in C that it relies upon for opimized performance.

- **Library**: A custom C library for GBA development, currently primarily focused on bitmap modes (Modes 3, 4, and 5).
- **NG**: A collection of Angular-based modules focused on simplified asset management with a GUI, with the ultimate intent of building a fully featured web-based GBA development engine. *Note: NG is currently in the setup phase* 

## Features

- **Library** (GBA C Library)
  - Optimized for GBA bitmap display modes: **Mode 3**, **Mode 4**, and **Mode 5**
  - VRAM management and low-level graphics handling
  - Basic physics and collision handling
  - Basic input handling
  - Basic sound control (DMG1 only, rest in progress)
- **NG** (Web Development Engine - Coming Soon)
  - Framework for creating a GBA development environment accessible online or locally
  - Modular design for flexibility, using as smaller individual applications as well as being integrated into a larger framework for gba development.
